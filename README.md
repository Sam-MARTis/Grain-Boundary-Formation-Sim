# Spatial Hashing

Plain collision checker with gravity.

Space is divided into grids so that each particle must check its neighbouring particles for collisions

Notice that you can see properties like point dislocations, line dislocations and occasional 'cubic' packing show up. In addition, the rearrangement of the dislocations is nothing but annealing.
